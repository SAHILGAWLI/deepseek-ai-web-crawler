        "title": "THEME 2: Strengthening Market Access for Women-Led Businesses",
        "description": "Women-led enterprises, especially within the micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise (MSME) sector, encounter significant hurdles when it comes to accessing broader markets. These obstacles stem from alabyrinth of supply chain barriers, a lack of robust digital visibility, and minimal engagement in procurement systems. As a result, these businesses often experience stagnated growth and diaminished revenue potential. The pressing challenge lies in crafting innovative solutions that not only strengthen market linkages but also enhance the digital footprint of women entrepreneurs. This effort aims to empower them to effectively integrate into formal supply chains and thrive on e-commerce platforms, unlocking their full potential and driving sustainable growth. Challenge Goal: Create a solution that helps women-led MSMEs reach bigger markets by improving their supply chain connections, increasing their online presence, and making it easier for them to join procurement systems. The solution should use technology to connect businesses with new opportunities, provide digital tools for growth, and support their success in supply chains and e-commerce platforms.",

This track focuses on enabling seamless data ingestion, enrichment, and interoperability between Splunk and third-party tools, making it easier for users to extract valuable insights from diverse data sources. Sample Problem Statements: Splunk Add-on Development IT Service Management Integration: As an integration engineer for a software vendor that has developed a SaaS product for secure identity and authentication, you are tasked with creating an integration that enables Splunk customers to collect authentication events from your product into Splunk. Your product exposes a REST API that can be used to retrieve these events, and you know that you can create \"modular inputs\" in Splunk to ingest data from external sources. Customers will require the ability to configure multiple tenants, as many customers use separate tenants for their different business units. Optimized Resource Allocation for DevOps: As an integration engineer for a software vendor that has developed a SaaS product for IT service management, you are tasked with creating an integration that enables Splunk customers to send events from their Splunk searches to their ticketing system for investigation. Your product exposes a webhook-based API that can be used from other products to create tickets, and you know that you can create \"modular alert actions\" in Splunk to act on results from searches. You'll also need a configuration page where details of the customer's tenant, such as URL and API token, can be provided by the customer. Threat Intelligence Integration: As an integration engineer for a cybersecurity vendor that provides a real-time threat intelligence feed (including malicious IP addresses, domains, and vulnerabilities), you are tasked with building a Splunk Technical Add-on. This Add-on will enable customers to pull threat intelligence data from your REST-based or streaming API into Splunk for enhanced security analytics. The Add-on should include a modular input to handle recurring data retrieval (with scheduling and robust error handling), automatic data parsing and enrichment (e.g., mapping fields to Splunk\u2019s Common Information Model), and a configuration page where customers can specify API credentials, data filtering options, and ingestion intervals. Additionally, the Add-on should incorporate best practices for data volume management, allowing customers to filter or throttle incoming threat data to match their licensing and operational requirements.

This theme encourages participants to simplify complex data workflows, optimize data processing, and extract meaningful insights. Sample Problem Statements: SPL2 Data Processing Reduce Log Volume: As a Network Operations Manager for a company that utilizes networking devices, you are tasked with effectively managing and monitoring the massive volume of logs that these devices generate. This high volume of network log data is leading to storage issues, longer processing times, and difficulty in finding relevant logs among the noise. It also increases the cost of log management and makes it challenging to comply with various data retention policies. For the provided data sources (X & Y), you are tasked with creating SPL2 pipelines that address these problems. Convert Logs to Metrics: As a Data Administrator, converting logs to metrics is a valuable tool for observability because it enhances performance monitoring, simplifies analysis, reduces storage costs, and enables real-time alerting at scale. The Ingest Processor supports a dedicated logs-to-metrics (L2M) function in SPL2 and allows routing data to both Splunk Metrics Index and Observability Cloud. For the provided data sources (X & Y), you are tasked with creating SPL2 pipelines that convert logs into useful metrics that downstream engineers, site-reliability engineers, and admins can consume.

This track focuses on enabling seamless data ingestion, enrichment, and interoperability between Splunk and third-party tools, making it easier for users to extract valuable insights from diverse data sources.\nSample Problem Statements: Splunk Add-on Development\n\n\nIT Service Management Integration: As an integration engineer for a software vendor that has developed a SaaS product for secure identity and authentication, you are tasked with creating an integration that enables Splunk customers to collect authentication events from your product into Splunk. Your product exposes a REST API that can be used to retrieve these events, and you know that you can create \"modular inputs\" in Splunk to ingest data from external sources. Customers will require the ability to configure multiple tenants, as many customers use separate tenants for their different business units.\n\n\nOptimized Resource Allocation for DevOps: As an integration engineer for a software vendor that has developed a SaaS product for IT service management, you are tasked with creating an integration that enables Splunk customers to send events from their Splunk searches to their ticketing system for investigation. Your product exposes a webhook-based API that can be used from other products to create tickets, and you know that you can create \"modular alert actions\" in Splunk to act on results from searches. You'll also need a configuration page where details of the customer's tenant, such as URL and API token, can be provided by the customer.\n\n\nThreat Intelligence Integration: As an integration engineer for a cybersecurity vendor that provides a real-time threat intelligence feed (including malicious IP addresses, domains, and vulnerabilities), you are tasked with building a Splunk Technical Add-on. This Add-on will enable customers to pull threat intelligence data from your REST-based or streaming API into Splunk for enhanced security analytics. The Add-on should include a modular input to handle recurring data retrieval (with scheduling and robust error handling), automatic data parsing and enrichment (e.g., mapping fields to Splunk\u2019s Common Information Model), and a configuration page where customers can specify API credentials, data filtering options, and ingestion intervals. Additionally, the Add-on should incorporate best practices for data volume management, allowing customers to filter or throttle incoming threat data to match their licensing and operational requirements.\n\n\nSupporting Links\n\n\nhttps://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/docs/welcome/\n\n\nhttps://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/docs/releaseapps/splunkbase/\n\n\nClick here\u00a0to learn about submission guidelines, tech stack requirements, and more details., , Track 2: Splunk Add-on Integration Development\n                    \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                                Overview\nCreate powerful Splunk Add-ons that integrate external data sources, services, and platforms with Splunk.
