    "organizer": "Jadavpur University (JU), Kolkata",
    "description": "Introduction:\nPass The Baton - Quest to Conquer, Relay to Reward.A team-based competitive programming contest, with a unique twist wherein each team member gets a shot at solving the same problem, but without any communication within the team, relying only on the clues left behind by the previous solver. It\u2019s a refreshing take on the traditional programming competition, challenging the participant\u2019s algorithmic prowess, quick thinking and teamwork capabilities.\nEVENT FORMAT\n\nThe event will consist of an online preliminary round and an on-site final round.\nThe prelims will be conducted on Codeforces and this will be an ICPC-style contest consisting of 6-8 problems, which must be solved in a 2 hour time frame. The top 20-25 teams from the prelims will qualify to the finals.\nThe final round will be hosted on Hackerrank and will be conducted on-site. Each of the three team members will be assigned a separate desktop.\nThe duration of this contest will be 2 hours. For the final round, the entire problem set will be divided into three parts and each team member will get exactly 30 minutes to work on each part, alternately. For example, in the first 30 minutes the three team members will be solving parts A, B and C respectively, in the next 30 minutes they will be solving parts C, A, B respectively, and so forth. Each part will consist of exactly 2 problems. Additionally, a bonus part consisting of 1-2 problems will be available in the last 30 minutes, and unlike previous parts, all 3 teammates can communicate and work together for these problems.Thus, three parts of 30 minutes each and one bonus part of 30 minutes for a total of 2 hours.\n\nEVENT RULES\n\nFor Prelims:-\n1. All participants must form a team on Codeforces and participate under the same team for the contest.\n2. All teams must submit their own solutions for each problem. Any team found guilty of plagiarism will face disqualification.\n3. There will be a 20-minute time penalty for each wrong submission. All three team members can make submissions for the problems in any order, but only the first correct submission for a problem will be considered.\n\nFor Finals:- 1. Participants can only use the online IDE on Hackerrank platform, while solving the problems. Changing to another tab or window during the contest is strictly prohibited. 2. Team members will be seated away from each other at their own desktops, and will not be able to directly communicate with each other during the contest (except for the bonus part in the last 30 mins). They can only view the code submissions made by the previous team member, for each problem. It is encouraged to leave comments in your code, so that you can share your approach/intended solution more effectively with the next team member. 3. During the bonus part at the last 30 mins, team members will be seated together and will be assigned a single desktop. The team can communicate and solve the problems together during this part. 4. There will be no time penalty for wrong submissions, and only the first correct submission for a problem, made by any of the three team members, will be considered.\n\nFor detailed problem statement: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LMUItjjFEXZ5HwdE-5F_dY6IxIWvQwr3/view",

As the tagline goes, \u201cCode, Navigate, Conquer!\u201d\nEligibility & Team Composition:\n\nEligibility: Open to all students making it an inclusive platform for emerging talent in robotics.\nTeam Size: Each team may consist of a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 3 members.\nTeam Flexibility: Cross-college teams are allowed, which means you can collaborate with peers from different institutions. This encourages a blend of diverse ideas and expertise in solving complex problems.\nInter-Specialization: Teams can comprise members from different specializations as long as they meet the competition criteria.\nRegistration: Registration is mandatory and must be completed by 5 April 2025. On successful registration, participants will receive a GitHub repository via email containing the simulation setup, the base algorithm, and other necessary resources.\u00a0\n\nCompetition Structure & Format:\nRound 1: Method Summary Submission:\nIn the first stage, teams are required to submit a detailed method summary that outlines their proposed approach for navigating the maze. This document should include:\n\nAlgorithm Explanation: A clear description of the navigation strategy, including any algorithms or heuristics you intend to use.\nApproach Feasibility: An assessment of the expected performance of your solution, backed by preliminary reasoning or simulation data if available.\nInnovation Factor: Creativity in tackling the maze\u2019s dynamic challenges is highly valued.This round is crucial as it filters the most promising submissions; only teams that demonstrate a well-thought-out approach will qualify for the second round.\n\nRound 2: Maze Navigation Challenge:\nQualified teams move on to a live simulation challenge where a random maze is generated in the Gazebo environment. Here, you must execute the navigation algorithm developed in Round 1. Key points include:\n\nAttempts: Each team is granted two attempts to solve the maze. The best attempt, measured by the fewest steps to reach the centre, is used for final scoring.\nTime Constraint: In each attempt, if the bot remains stuck for more than 30 seconds, the attempt will be marked invalid. This ensures that your algorithm is not only efficient but also robust in handling unforeseen obstacles.\nScoring System:\n\nThe primary metric is the number of steps taken by the bot to reach the centre of the maze.\nIn the event of a tie, the tie-breaker will be determined by the lowest total net steps across both attempts, ensuring a fair assessment of overall performance.\n\n\n\nSensor Constraints & Technical Guidelines:\n\nAllowed Sensors: Teams are permitted to use sensors such as LiDAR, proximity sensors, wheel odometry, and IMU. These sensors must be utilized in a manner that does not compromise the challenge\u2019s integrity.\nProhibited Sensors: Any sensor that can provide a top-down view of the maze or enables the bot to \u201ccheat\u201d by seeing beyond the maze walls is strictly forbidden.\nSimulation Integrity: Any attempt to modify the simulation environment or manually interfere during runtime will lead to immediate disqualification. This rule enforces a level playing field and ensures that every team competes under the same conditions.\n\nCode of Conduct & Disqualification Criteria:Maintaining integrity and fairness is paramount. All participants are expected to abide by a strict code of conduct:\n\nFair Play: Use only the authorized sensors and follow the guidelines set out in the rulebook.\nDocumentation: Timely submission of the required method summary and adherence to deadlines are mandatory.\nDisqualification: Breaching any of the rules, such as using unauthorized sensors, altering the simulation environment, or failing to submit documentation, will result in disqualification. This ensures that all competitors are judged solely on their technical and problem-solving skills.\n\nAdditional Competition Details:\n\nInnovation & Strategy: Emphasis is placed on creative problem-solving and the efficient execution of your navigation strategy.\nEvaluation: A panel of judges will assess submissions based on feasibility, innovation, and overall performance in the simulation round.\nContact & Support: For any queries or further assistance, you can reach out directly to the event heads:\n\nParth Sachdeva: +91 9149663246, 2023ucs0105@iitjammu.ac.in\nPurushartha Gupta: +91 9369573768, 2023uce0062@iitjammu.ac.in\n\n\n\nThis extended and comprehensive competition description aims to cover all aspects of the challenge\u2014from eligibility and rules to scoring and disqualification criteria\u2014ensuring that potential participants are fully informed and prepared. Good luck, and may your code navigate the maze to triumph",

    "title": "Prosperity",
    "organizer": "IMC Trading",
    "description": "What is Prosperity?\nProsperity is a 15-day-long trading challenge happening somewhere in a near-utopian future. You\u2019re in control of an island in an archipelago, and your goal is to bring your island to prosperity. You do so by earning as many SeaShells as possible, the main currency in the archipelago. The more SeaShells you earn, the more your island will prosper.\nDuring your 15 days on the island, your trading abilities will be tested through a variety of trading challenges. It\u2019s up to you to develop a successful trading strategy. You will be working on a Python script to handle algorithmic trades on your behalf. Every round also presents a manual trading challenge; a one-off challenge that is separate from your algorithmic trading and could yield some additional profits. Your success depends on both these algorithmic and manual trades.\nTake a deep breath and smell the opportunities drifting by with the ocean breeze. It\u2019s up to you to seize those opportunities and lead your island into prosperity. At times, it will be challenging, hard even, but for those who know how to work the market to their favor, the reward will be bountiful.\nProsperity Storyline:\nThe main character in the game is a cockatoo who lives in the archipelago. Besides a cockatoo, he is also the news anchor for Tropical TV. Every round, he\u2019ll give you the latest headlines, all you need to know to progress in the game. The news broadcasts from Tropical TV will play an important role during our 15-day trading challenge. The cockatoo will give a short update on what happened in the previous round before he discloses this round\u2019s assignment and tradable goods. During the trading season, you\u2019ll meet all kinds of interesting characters. Some from within our own archipelago and some that we consider our neighbours. All of them have their own unique story. You should definitely keep your ears peeled for those stories because every real trading tycoon knows that within every story, there is an opportunity to be found. You just have to know how to turn that compelling story into a profitable strategy.\nRounds:\nThe 15 days of simulation of Prosperity are divided into 5 rounds with each round lasting 72 hours. At the end of every round - before the timer runs out - all teams will have to submit their algorithmic and manual trades to be processed. The algorithms will then participate in a full day of trading against the Prosperity trading bots. Note that all algorithms are trading separately, there is no interaction between the algorithms of different players. When a new round starts, the results of the previous round will be disclosed and the leaderboard will be updated accordingly. During the game, you can always visit previous rounds in the dashboard, to review information and results. But once a round is closed, you can no longer change your submitted trades for that round. When round 5 ends, the final results will be processed and the winner of the Prosperity trading challenge will be announced.\nAlgorithmic Trading:\nEvery round contains an algorithmic trading challenge. You will have 72 hours to submit your (final) Python program. When the round ends, the last successfully processed submission will be locked in and processed for results.\n\nTutorial: February 24, 1530 hrs \u2192 April 7, 1530 hrs\nRound 1: April 7, 1530 hrs \u2192 April 10, 1530 hrs\nRound 2: April 10, 1530 hrs \u2192 April 13, 1530 hrs\nRound 3: April 13, 1530 hrs \u2192 April 16, 1530 hrs\nRound 4: April 16, 1530 hrs \u2192 April 19, 1530 hrs\nRound 5: April 19, 1530 hrs \u2192 April 22, 1530 hrs\n\nAll rounds contain a manual trading challenge. Just like the algorithmic challenge, manual trading challenges last 72 hours to submit your (final) trade. When the round ends, the last submission will be locked in and processed for results. During the tutorial round, manual trading is inactive. Note that manual trades have no effect on your algorithmic trade and can be seen as separate challenges to gain additional profits.\nGuidelines:\n\nIt\u2019s a 15-day live trading simulation (don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not full-time).\nYou can participate as a lone wolf or in a team size of up to 5 members.\nJoin fully remotely, from anywhere, alone or in a team.",

It offers participants the opportunity to showcase their coding skills while employing tactical decision-making through an auction system.\nThe event aims to test participants' coding proficiency and their ability to make strategic bids to maximize their success.\nEvent Structure:\nThe event will consist of two primary rounds:\n\nAuction Round\nCoding Round\n\n Auction Round:\n\nTeams must consist of 3 to 4 members.\nOut of these members, 2 members will be responsible for coding, and the remaining 1 or 2 members will handle the auctioning.\nEach team will receive an initial purse of 120 points (bidding currency).\nA set of challenging coding questions will be presented for auction in three categories:\n\nEasy: Base price 30 points, each bid increases price by 15 points\nMedium: Base price 20 points, each bid increases price by 10 points\nHard: Base price 15 points, each bid increases price by 5 points\n\n\nTeams must bid to purchase the questions using their points.\nThe bid amount will be deducted from the team\u2019s purse upon successful purchase of a question.\nEach team must purchase exactly 3 questions to qualify for the next round. Teams cannot purchase more or fewer than 3 questions, and failing to secure exactly 3 will result in elimination.\nIf a team is unable to purchase 3 questions due to insufficient points, they will be eliminated.\nAtleast one easy question is Compulsory to purchase.\n\n Coding Round:\n\nThe coding round will be conducted immediately after the auction.\nThe team members who were not involved in the auction will be responsible for solving the purchased questions.\nTeams will be evaluated based on:\n\nThe correctness of the solutions.\nThe time taken to solve the problems.\n\n\nEach problem category will have a different weightage to ensure a balanced competition. The point distribution is designed to reflect the relative difficulty of each category while maintaining fairness across all possible question combinations.\n\nEasy: 20 points\nMedium: 35 points\nHard: 40 points\n\n\nIn case multiple teams solve all their questions correctly, ranking will be based on the completion time.\nThe top 3 teams with the best performance will be declared winners.\n\nGuidelines:\n\nOpen to UG/PG Students of all Colleges and all Courses\nTotal Duration of Competition will be 3 hours (Auction [2 hours] + Coding [1 hour] Round)\nThere will be 3 problems related to coding , Data Structures and Algorithms\u00a0\n\nEvent Rules:\n\nEach team must have 3 to 4 members.\nThe auctioning team members cannot participate in the coding round.\nThe initial bidding purse is 120 points.\nEach question will have a base price, and teams must bid to acquire questions.\nA team must successfully purchase at least 3 questions to proceed to the coding round.\nFailure to buy at least 3 questions will result in elimination. Teams should plan their bids strategically, as no rebidding opportunities will be provided once their purse is exhausted.\nThe coding round will be evaluated based on accuracy and completion time.\nThe top 3 teams will be awarded prizes based on their performance.",
