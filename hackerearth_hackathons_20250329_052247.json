This track focuses on enabling seamless data ingestion, enrichment, and interoperability between Splunk and third-party tools, making it easier for users to extract valuable insights from diverse data sources.\nSample Problem Statements: Splunk Add-on Development\n\n\nIT Service Management Integration: As an integration engineer for a software vendor that has developed a SaaS product for secure identity and authentication, you are tasked with creating an integration that enables Splunk customers to collect authentication events from your product into Splunk. Your product exposes a REST API that can be used to retrieve these events, and you know that you can create \"modular inputs\" in Splunk to ingest data from external sources. Customers will require the ability to configure multiple tenants, as many customers use separate tenants for their different business units.\n\n\nOptimized Resource Allocation for DevOps: As an integration engineer for a software vendor that has developed a SaaS product for IT service management, you are tasked with creating an integration that enables Splunk customers to send events from their Splunk searches to their ticketing system for investigation. Your product exposes a webhook-based API that can be used from other products to create tickets, and you know that you can create \"modular alert actions\" in Splunk to act on results from searches. You'll also need a configuration page where details of the customer's tenant, such as URL and API token, can be provided by the customer.\n\n\nThreat Intelligence Integration: As an integration engineer for a cybersecurity vendor that provides a real-time threat intelligence feed (including malicious IP addresses, domains, and vulnerabilities), you are tasked with building a Splunk Technical Add-on. This Add-on will enable customers to pull threat intelligence data from your REST-based or streaming API into Splunk for enhanced security analytics. The Add-on should include a modular input to handle recurring data retrieval (with scheduling and robust error handling), automatic data parsing and enrichment (e.g., mapping fields to Splunk\u2019s Common Information Model), and a configuration page where customers can specify API credentials, data filtering options, and ingestion intervals. Additionally, the Add-on should incorporate best practices for data volume management, allowing customers to filter or throttle incoming threat data to match their licensing and operational requirements.\n\n\nSupporting Links\n\n\nhttps://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/docs/welcome/\n\n\nhttps://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/docs/releaseapps/splunkbase/\n\n\nClick here\u00a0to learn about submission guidelines, tech stack requirements, and more details., , Track 2: Splunk Add-on Integration Development\n                    \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                                Overview\nCreate powerful Splunk Add-ons that integrate external data sources, services, and platforms with Splunk.
